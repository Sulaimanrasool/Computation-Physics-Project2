Instructions to run the project code, and obtain results required by the assignment.

Aim of the project was to calcualte the probability of 1D and 3D quantum-mechanical systems using Newton-Coates integration and Monte Carlo integration. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The .zip file initially contains the following items:

1) 'monte_carlo_integration.py' - python file:
  This contains the code developed calcaulte the probability of the 1D and 3D probability of the quantum fucntions. It contains 'monte_carlo_func' which is the 1D monte carlo integrator, the 'three_dimen_monte' function which is the 3D monte carlo integrator. The file also contains 4 validation functions, the 1D ground state func, the 3D ground state func and the 3D first state func. It also has the PDF function and the PDF biasing function as per the transformation function. 
 
 The file produces all results shown in the report.
  

2) 'newton_coates.py ' - python file:
	This contains the code developed needed to answer the second question from the assignment. The question is to write code to carry out LU decomposition of an arbitarty N x N matrix using Crouts algorithm. The file produces the results shown in the report. 

3) 'Sulaiman_Rasool_Project2_Dec_2020.pdf' - PDF file
   This contains the project report, highlighitng the research work.

******* How to run the data **********

Each python file is self-contained. Running each file will produce the results shown in the report.
